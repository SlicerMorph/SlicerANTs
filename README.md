# SlicerANTs

ANTs computes high-dimensional mapping to capture the statistics of brain structure and function.

This is a Slicer extension for exposing ANTsWasm,
a package which provides a WebAssembly, Python, and C++ interfaces to ANTs.
This interface is a performant interface inspired by ANTsPy and ANTsR.
